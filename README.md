# traffic-monitor

## Introduction
This project aims to reduce the manual labor associated with traffic surveying. The solution proposed uses an inexpensive Raspberry Pi 3 Board B+ with an attached Camera V2 module to perform vehicle counting, speed calculations, and data logging. This opens the possibility to identify areas of high speed violations and provides cost savings through the removal of human counters.
